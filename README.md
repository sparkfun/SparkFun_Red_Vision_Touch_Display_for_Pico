The SparkFun Red Vision Touch Display for Pico features a 2.0", 320x240px capacative touch LCD mounted on a breakout board designed to plug directly into the Control Board on the [Experiential Robotics Platform (XRP) Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/experiential-robotics-platform-xrp-kit.html) as well as Raspberry Pi Picos. This display board includes a connector specifically designed to allow you to plug the [SparkFun Red Vision Camera Board - HM01B0 (Color)](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-red-vision-camera-board-hm01b0-color.html) or other 2x9 connection type camera boards into the display board. Both of these boards work with the SparkFun MicroPython OpenCV port so you can add image processing, object detection, contour detection and other advanced machine vision and display features to your XRP robot. The [SparkFun Red Vision Kit for XRP](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-pico-vision-kit-for-xrp.html) contains both the display board as well as a camera board with headers for users who want to use both boards on their XRP robot with no soldering required.
